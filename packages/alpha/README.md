Cognite Javascript SDK (alpha)
================================
The package `@cognite/sdk-alpha` provides a subset of API bindings to the CDF alpha APIs. Note that this package is considered unstable and may periodically be out of date for certain resources. The alpha SDK is not recommended for production and should only be used if you know what you are doing.
When a resource is removed from the alpha it _may_ be found in the beta or stable packages, unless they are discontinued.

install instructions:
```
yarn add @cognite/sdk-alpha
```
or with npm
```
npm install @cognite/sdk-alpha --save
```

This will download `@cognite/sdk-alpha`. Import the `CogniteClientAlpha`:
```js
import CogniteClientAlpha from '@cognite/sdk-alpha';
```

The CogniteClientAlpha can be initialized/configured in the same manner as the other packages (eg. stable, beta, etc.).
