# Notice on code generation for models API
Code generation is currently unreliable in models due to codegen not correctly
detecting all shared types across the different data modeling APIs.

Until this is resolved, follow the following process to generate new types:
1. Rename `codegen.skip.json` to `codegen.json`
2. Generate types with `yarn codegen generate-types --package=stable`
3. Copy the new instance autogenerated exports from `../exports.gen.ts` into the corresponding existing exports for instances in `../types.ts` and overwrite the old ones.
4. Resolve any new duplicate types by deleting them from the newly added export lines.
5. Delete the newly generated exports in `types.gen.ts`
6. Rename `codegen.json` to `codegen.skip.json`
