Cognite Javascript SDK (derived)
================================
This package provides an SDK derived from `@cognite/sdk`, aka
[stable](https://github.com/cognitedata/cognite-sdk-js/blob/master/packages/stable/README.md).

It is recomended to install this package under the same name as `@cognite/sdk`.
This allows you to change SDK versions without changing your imports.
See the [beta readme](https://github.com/cognitedata/cognite-sdk-js/blob/master/packages/beta/README.md) for details.
