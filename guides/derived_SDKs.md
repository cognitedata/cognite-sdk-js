# Derived SDKs HOW-TO

This document serves as a guide for working with SDK packages.
First there is an overview, describing the most important packages
in the repository and how they interact. Then there are guides for
creating your own SDK packages, how to add APIs to the SDK, how to
make a derived SDK, and how to override APIs from the derived SDK.

## Overview of packages

### @cognite/sdk-core
exports a `BaseCogniteClient` ([docs](https://cognitedata.github.io/cognite-sdk-js/core/classes/basecogniteclient.html)) which supports logging in, upon which it creates
a `CDFHttpClient` containing the API keys needed to interact with the API.
Helper functions for logging in with browser popups and redirects also live here, and a generic `BaseResourceApi<T>` class provides protected templated methods for working with resource APIs with
pagination and chunking.

### @cognite/sdk (stable)
exports a `CogniteClient` ([docs](https://cognitedata.github.io/cognite-sdk-js/classes/cogniteclient.html)) which inherits from the `BaseCogniteClient` to add accessors to all stable API endpoints. Endpoint access is grouped by resource type. Example: `TimeSeriesAPI` ([docs](https://cognitedata.github.io/cognite-sdk-js/classes/timeseriesapi.html)) lets you create, filter, count, delete time series.

Most types used in requests and responses are defined as interfaces and type aliases in `src/types.ts`,
and closely mimic the structure of the REST API.

### @cognite/sdk-beta
depends on both stable and core, and uses inheritance to augment the stable sdk.
The resulting class is exported as `CogniteClient` ([docs](https://cognitedata.github.io/cognite-sdk-js/beta/classes/cogniteclient.html)), and the rest of stable is forward-exported as well,
which makes the beta package behave as stable by default. To understand how the beta class can override
parts of stable, see the sections below.

### Any other potential packages
This is not an exhaustive list, because you can create your own packages.
See the sections below.

# Creating an SDK derived from stable

To create a new package, copy the `packages/template` folder in place and give it a new name. Go into the folder and change `package.json` to give the npm package a name. Tooling expects the package name to match the folder name like so:
```json
    "private": true,
    "name": "@cognite/sdk-<folder name>",
    "version": "0.0.0",
```
Keep the package private until it's ready to be published, since CI will version and publish all public packages
when releases are triggered.

You should also update the `"test"` script to run the tests inside your newly created folder:
```json
        "test": "jest --config=../../jest.config.js --testPathPattern=/<folder name>/",
```

Finally, if you want docs from this SDK to appear as a subfolder on the reference docs,
add the following script, which will run when docs are built for deployment:
```json
        "docs:bundle": "yarn docs && mkdir -p ../../docs/<subfolder> && cp -r docs/* ../../docs/<subfolder>/" 
```

The `README.md` file will appear on npm if published, so write something about the package.

## The structure of a package
In your newly created folder you will find some config files and a `src/` directory.
```
 src/
 |--> __test__/
 |--> cogniteClient.ts
 \--> index.ts
```

The client is defined in `cogniteClient.ts` and is exported from `index.ts`.
The simplest possible client (derived from stable) looks like this:
```ts
import { CogniteClient as CogniteClientStable } from '@cognite/sdk';

export default class CogniteClient extends CogniteClientStable {

}
```
With the accompanying `index.ts`:
```ts
export * from '@cognite/sdk';
export { default as CogniteClient } from './cogniteClient';
```

# Adding endpoints to an SDK

Endpoints are all implemented as functions on subclasses of `BaseResourceAPI<T>`, but that is not a strict
requirement. The class simply helps with common actions on resources (when the REST API is laid out like in CDF), and the generic parameter lets you specify
the type. For an example, see `TimeSeriesAPI` [here](../packages/stable/src/api/timeSeries/timeSeriesApi.ts).
The class has several endpoints, most of which already have generic implementations in the superclass.

Let's define a new API class in `src/api/coolThing/coolThingApi.ts`:
```ts
import {
    BaseResourceAPI,
    InternalId,
    CursorAndAsyncIterator,
} from '@cognite/sdk-core';

export interface ExternalCoolThing {
    name: string;
    coolness: number;
}

export type CoolThing = ExternalCoolThing & InternalId;

export interface CoolThingQuery {
    /** Only get cool things at least this cool */
    min?: number;

    /** Only get cool things no cooler than */
    max?: number;
}

export class CoolThingAPI extends BaseResource<CoolThing> {

    /**
    * [Create cool things](https://doc.cognitedata.com/api/v1/#operation/postCoolThing)
    *
    * ```js
    * const coolthings = [
    *   { name: 'Shrub', coolness: 40 },
    *   { name: 'Cactus', coolness: 80 },
    * ];
    * const created = await client.coolThing.create(coolthings);
    * ```
    */
    public create = (items: ExternalCoolThing[]): Promise<CoolThing[]> => {
        return super.createEndpoint(items);
    };

    /** <docstring here> */
    public list = (query?: CoolThingQuery): CursorAndAsyncIterator<CoolThing> => {
        return super.listEndpoints(this.callListEndpointWithPost, query);
    }
}
```

The `CogniteClient` class makes instances of these classes in `initAPIs()`, which is called once credentials and project name are set. The accessor helper `accessApi()` reminds the user to set credentials before using APIs.

Let's add our `CoolThingAPI` to our derived `CogniteClient`.
```ts
import { CogniteClient as CogniteClientStable } from '@cognite/sdk';
import { CoolThingAPI } from './api/coolThing/coolThingApi';
import { accessApi } from '@cognite/sdk-core';

export default class CogniteClient extends CogniteClientStable {

    private coolThingApi?: CoolThingAPI;

    protected initAPIs() {
        super.initAPIs();

        // Turns into $BASE_URL/api/$API_VERSION/projects/$PROJECT/coolthing
        this.coolThingApi = this.apiFactory(CoolThingAPI, 'coolthing');
    }

    get coolThing(): CoolThingAPI {
        return accessApi(this.coolThingApi);
    }
}
```

The resulting CogniteClient now contains all API classes from stable, as well as our new API class.
When you create API classes, they should be exported in `index.ts`, along with any types used by
the API class.
```ts
export * from '@cognite/sdk';
export { default as CogniteClient } from './cogniteClient';
export {
    CoolThingAPI,
    ExternalCoolThing,
    CoolThing,
    CoolThingQuery,
} from './api/coolThing/coolThingApi';
```

In the stable API all type definitions are placed in `types.ts`, and then `*` is exported from `types.ts`. If `CoolThingAPI` was in stable, the types would be there instead, and we wouldn't have to explicitly export them in `index.ts`.

In derived SDKs, it is recommended to put the types with the API file that uses it.
Then it is easier to see what has been changed when moving features to stable.

# Adding an endpoint in a derived API class

Let's say we are writing an SDK derived from stable and want to add a new endpoint in `TimeSeriesAPI`.
To do this, we can create our own `TimeSeriesAPI` class inheriting from the stable class,
and put our new endpoint there.

We make our own `src/api/timeseries/timeSeriesApi.ts`:
```ts
import { TimeSeriesAPI as TimeSeriesAPIStable } from '@cognite/sdk';
import { InternalId } from '@cognite/sdk-core';

export class TimeSeriesAPI extends TimeSeriesAPIStable {
    /** <docstring> */
    public flip = async (id: InternalId) => {
        const path = this.url('flip');
        const response = await this.post(path, { data: { id }});
        return this.addToMapAndReturn({}, response);
    }
}
```

Then we need to use this new `TimeSeriesAPI` in the client. It's not enough to
give it the same name. We must re-define the `timeseries` field to return an instance
of our new class. The problem is that stable's `CogniteClient.timeseries` already has a defined type.
Subclasses normally can't broaden the type of fields. We do however have a trick:
```ts
import { CogniteClient as CogniteClientStable } from '@cognite/sdk';
import { TimeSeriesAPI } from './api/timeSeries/timeSeriesApi';

class CogniteClientCleaned extends CogniteClientStable {
    // Remove type restriction on timeseries
    timeseries: any;
}

export default class CogniteClient extends CogniteClientCleaned {

    private timeSeriesApi?: TimeSeriesAPI;
    protected initAPIs() {
        super.initAPIs();
        this.timeSeriesApiBeta = this.apiFactory(TimeSeriesAPI, 'timeseries');
    }

    get timeseries(): TimeSeriesAPI {
        return accessApi(this.timeSeriesApiBeta);
    }
}
```

Typescript always allows the `any` type to be used, which weakens the type of `timeseries` in `CogniteClientCleaned`.
We can then override that class again, and specify the correct strict type.
IDEs now understand that the `timeseries` field has the new type, and gives correct suggestions.

It is now very important to export this new `TimeSeriesAPI` in `index.ts`:
```ts
export * from '@cognite/sdk'; // This /won't/ export TimeSeriesAPI
export { default as CogniteClient } from './cogniteClient';
export { TimeSeriesAPI } from './api/timeSeries/timeSeriesApi'; // Because we export it here
```

Because we specify by name, it will take precedence over `export * from @cognite/sdk`,
which normally exports its own `TimeSeriesAPI`.

# Changing existing endpoints and types

If you want to change an existing endpoint, such as adding a field to time series,
the easiest way is to completely copy the `timeSeriesApi.ts` file. In here you define your
own `Timeseries` interface, instead of importing it from `../../types`.
You must then export this new API class and new type, just like in previous sections.

The resulting `index.ts` should look something like this:
```ts
export * from '@cognite/sdk'; // This /won't/ export Timeseries
export { default as CogniteClient } from './cogniteClient';
export { TimeSeriesAPI, Timeseries } from './api/timeSeries/timeSeriesApi';
```

# Adding tests

Each SDK has its own `src/__tests__/` folder where all `*.test.ts` and `*.spec.ts` get run.
There are some example tests in the template, but you should add your own, in separate files
for separate API classes.

# Accessing endpoints from outside of CDF

If you want to access a different domain, it is recommended to make your own
 `BasicHttpClient` ([docs](https://cognitedata.github.io/cognite-sdk-js/beta/classes/basichttpclient.html)). You specify a `baseUrl` in the constructor, and relative paths in calls to `get`, `post` etc.
 
Example of a custom `CogniteClient` class with an external API:
```ts
import { BasicHttpClient } from '@cognite/sdk-core';

export default class CogniteClient extends CogniteClientStable {

    private openDoor?: (name: string) => Promise<boolean>;

    protected initAPIs() {
        super.initAPIs();

        const doorClient = new BasicHttpClient("https://example.com");

        type DoorState = {
            open: boolean;
        };

        this.openDoor = async (name: string) => {
            // calls https://example.com/doors/open?name=<name>
            const response = await doorClient.post<DoorState>('doors/open', { params: { name } });
            return response.data.open;
        }
    }

    get doorControl() {
        return {
            openDoor: accessApi(this.openDoor)
        };
    }
}
```
You may also provide full paths (starting in `http://` or `https://`) to `get`, `post`, etc.,
which will cause the `baseUrl` to be ignored. 


# Compiling and testing your SDK

The monorepo tooling will compile and test all packages when commits are pushed to GitHub,
but you can also (and should) do it locally.

You should first make sure all packages are built, since your dependencies live in the repository.
```sh
yarn
yarn build
```

After this is done, you can go into your package folder and run
```
yarn test
```

Whenever you make changes, remember to `yarn build`, and if other packages in the repo change,
go back to the root and run the command there.

# Creating an SDK not derived from stable
If you want to make an SDK derived from a beta or alpha, replace the dependency on `@cognite/sdk` with the correct package,
and yarn workspace will find it. All imports must be changed to the new package.
In theory all SDK versions are quite similar, except for additions and small changes, so find & replace on imports should mostly work.
```ts
import { CogniteClient as CogniteClientStable } from '@cognite/sdk-beta';
```

If however, you want to create an SDK not based on any existing SDK, you only need to depend on core.
The stable SDK is such an SDK, see [stable/src/cogniteClient.ts](../packages/stable/src/cogniteClient.ts).

# Publishing your SDK

There are two ways of publishing your derived SDK.

Any package with `"private": false` in the master branch will be published
to npm when a `[release]` commit happens. The version number will also be automatically
bumped based on commit messages. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

**NOTE:** If you depend on e.g. `stable`, and `stable` changes, your PATCH version will be bumped
to use the new version of `stable`.

It's also possible to keep your package private and only release it manually.
In this case you need to update the version and versions of dependencies yourself.

# Using a derived SDK as a drop-in replacement

If your derived SDK is backwards compatible with its parent, you can use your derived SDK under an alias to make it a drop-in replacement.
Let's say you have a feature in `@cognite/sdk-beta@1.3.0` that
you would like to use in an app where `@cognite/sdk` is a dependency.

Assuming the beta package is published to npm, use the following line in the app's `package.json`:
```json
"dependencies": {
    "@cognite/sdk": "npm:@cognite/sdk-beta@^1.3.0",
    ...
}
```
Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install the beta in place of stable, with the same name.
All your imports will stay the same, but now reference the beta package.
```ts
import { CogniteClient } from '@cognite/sdk'; // Now gives the beta client
```

# Moving features upstream

One of the main use cases for derived SDKs is implementing experimental features before they
reach stable. When the features do reach stable, the SDK implementation should move as well.
The guides above try making this move as painless as possible, and in general the following should be enough:
 - Move the new API class file to replace the old one
 - Move types into `types.ts` if applicable (e.g. when moving to stable)
 - Move any tests concerning new features
 - Remove overridden API class accessors
 - build & test
 - Look very hard at the diff to see that you didn't lose anything
